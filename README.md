# ü§ñ Union Circle Bot Improvements

## Overview

This project enhances the Union Circle Discord bot for Pok√©mon Legends, focusing on improving the queue system, optimizing code organization, and adding new features for better host and player experience.

## üÜï Major Improvements

### Enhanced Queue System

- **Registration Flow**: More intuitive and error-resistant registration process

### Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Reorganized code with clear separation of concerns
- **Service-based Design**: Core functionality moved to service modules
- **Improved Error Handling**: Centralized error management with helpful messages
- **Optimized Database**: JSON-based storage with caching for better performance
- **Extended Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for easier debugging

### New Features
- **User Status Check**: Players can check their position in queue with `/status`
- **Enhanced Session Management**: Direct `/session` commands for hosts
- **Registration Cards**: Visual confirmation cards when registering for sessions
